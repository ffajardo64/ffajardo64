# üí´ About Me:
I am passionate and experienced in the field of Statistics. With an inquisitive mind
and a genuine love for continuous learning in the world of statistical modeling,
time series and econometrics.

Since the beginning of my career I have had a special affinity for Statistics and
exceptional ability to understand and model complex data.
His passion for the subject has led him to explore various avenues, including computational modeling.

My journey began with BASIC, a common starting point for many programming enthusiasts.
common starting point for many programming enthusiasts. However, his curiosity
and dedication pushed him to expand his repertoire to include an
impressive range of languages, including C, Oxmetrics, R, Python,
Julia and even SAS, RATS, Eviews, VBA, LaTeX, ViM, among others. My
proficiency in these languages and software is testimony to my unwavering
commitment to improving my skills and knowledge.

In addition, I have also ventured into markup languages, such as
Markdown, and web development, mastering HTML and CSS to create content
and interactive applications, all to effectively communicate complex ideas in the world of
ideas in the world of Statistics and beyond.

I'm currently immersed in learning Arduino and Raspberry Pi, exploring
the potential of these technologies to develop practical and interactive applications
in data collection. This interdisciplinary and practical approach exemplifies my
desire to bring Statistics into real life, making it accessible and understandable to a diverse
